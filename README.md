### What I learned

How to effectively use flexbox and grid to come up with a working frontend project. Use of technologies such as grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows simplify the work 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="container">
  <p>hello</p>
  </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  grid-template-columns:repeat(3,1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr 2fr;
}
```
